# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
The objective of this analysis was to find out how many employees at Pewlett Hackard are elligible for retirement with respect to each job title at the company. The results from this project will help the company begin prepping to fill many vacant roles in the not so distant future and possibly give them a way to make the retire/rehire process run smoother. 
###Process
To perform this analysis I started by inspecting all of the data in the csv files to get an understanding of what needed to be done to achieve my goal. Next I created an ERD diagram using QuickDBD to get a visualization of how each file was related. Then I wrote SQL queries in postgres to create tables to upload the data from each file into. Finally I wrote SQL queries to parse through each data table and extract the information I needed in order to form my final conclusions.
##Summary
###Results
The results found were that a significant amount of employees have become elligible for retirement in each department at the company. This creates a bit of an issue for Pewlett Hackard because they will now have to fill many rolls and will also have to train all the new hires.
###Solution
After seeing realizing the actual size of the "silver-tsunami", we came up with a solution for the looming problems. We're proposing that a mentorship program that allows retirees to work part time at the company to help train the new hires. This gives the retirees a way to ease into retirement and the company a way to ease the new hires into their respective rolls.
